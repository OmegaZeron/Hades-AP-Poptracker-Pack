# Hades Archipelago PopTracker Pack
Tracker pack for [PopTracker](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/)

[Archipelago Setup Guide](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en)

[Hades Archipelago Randomizer Setup Guide](https://github.com/NaixGames/Polycosmos)

## Installation
Get the [latest pack](https://github.com/OmegaZeron/Hades-AP-Poptracker-Pack/releases/latest) from the releases page. Then drag and drop the .zip file onto the open PopTracker window, or move it into the /poptracker/packs folder.

This pack features auto-update, so you should be prompted to update when you open the pack.

## Connecting to Archipelago
Click the AP button in the top left of the window. Enter your server:port (most likely archipelago.gg:PORT_NUMBER), then enter your slot name (the name in your YAML file), then the server password (if there is one). Afterward, the AP button should turn green, which means you're now auto-tracking.

## Notes
* When set to Reverse Heat, your intial Pact items should be the same as your Pact settings. As you collect Pact items, the amount in the tracker should go down
* The Hades boss is not auto-tracked due to how the randomizer places locations. There is still a square for him so you can manually track which weapons you've beat him with, for the "Weapon CLears Needed" setting
